<p>This document contains important information on the safe operation
of mobile communication devices. Some of the information may not apply
to your device.</p>

<p>Please read all of the safety
information carefully before using your device to ensure its safe
and proper operation and to learn how to dispose of your device properly. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Electronic device</h2><p>Do not use your device if its use is prohibited or if it may cause danger or interference with other electronic devices.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Interference with medical equipment</h2><ul>
<li>Adhere to any rules or regulations set forth by hospitals and health care facilities.</li>

<li>Some wireless devices may affect the performance of hearing aids or pacemakers. For more information, contact your service provider.</li>

<li>Pacemaker manufacturers recommend maintaining a minimum distance of 15 cm between a pacemaker and a wireless device to prevent potential interference with the pacemaker. If using a pacemaker, hold the device on the
side opposite the pacemaker and do not carry the device in your front pocket.</li>

<li>This device is not a medical device. Health-related
apps are not designed to predict, diagnose or treat medical conditions.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Hearing guidelines</h2><p><span><img height="38" src="../image/safety/image_ear_eu.png"/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent possible hearing damage, do not
listen at high volume levels for long periods.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Battery safety</h2><ul>
<li>Do not bridge the battery terminals with conductive material, such as keys or jewellery. Doing so will short-circuit the battery and may cause injury.</li>

<li>Keep the battery away from excessive heat and direct sunlight. Do not place it on or in heating devices, such as microwave ovens, stoves, or radiators. Batteries may explode if overheated.</li>

<li>Do not attempt to modify the battery, insert foreign objects into it, or immerse or expose it to liquids. Doing so may lead to fire, explosion, or other hazards.</li>

<li>If the battery leaks, ensure that the electrolyte does not make contact with your skin or eyes. If contact is made, immediately flush with clean water and consult a doctor.</li>

<li>In case of battery deformation, discolouration
or overheating while charging or storing, or if the device standby
time shortens significantly, the battery may be damaged. Continued
use may lead to battery leakage, fire or an explosion.</li>

<li>Do not dispose of batteries in fire as they may explode. Damaged batteries may also explode.</li>

<li>Do not solder battery poles or dismantle the battery. Doing so may lead to electrolyte leakage, excessive heat, fire, or explosion.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Cleaning and maintenance</h2><ul>
<li>Keep the device and accessories dry. Do not attempt to dry it with an external heat source, such as a microwave oven or hair dryer.</li>

<li>Charging your device for too long or leaving
the battery unused for a long period of time may decrease the lifespan
of the battery and reduce performance.</li>

for assistance or repair.</li>

<li>If your device is damaged due to being hit
by a hard object or suffering a strong impact, do not touch or attempt
to remove any broken pieces. Stop using the device immediately and
contact an authorised service centre.</li>
